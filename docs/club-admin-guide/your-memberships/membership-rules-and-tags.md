# Membership Rules And Tags

Membership rules and tags are the tools for you as a club admin to grant full control of:

- When memberships expire
- What tags are applied to your members
- Who can purchase your products.

It is essential for you to configure your tags to manage:

- Membership Rules
- Membership Products

Both work together to create your membership system, you can make the configuration in these two places as table below:

| Item                    | Location                                                  | What It Controls                                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Membership Rules**    | Your Club's Page > Club Admin > Membership rules and tags | Which tags grant access to your club group      |
| **Membership Products** | Product Settings (When creating or modifying products)    | Which tags are applied on purchase, who can buy |

---

## What Can Tags Do?

Membership tags can:

- **Grant access** to your club’s private members-only group
- **Control** who can see member-only content and deals
- **Expire** on dates you set, requiring members to renew
- **Restrict** who can purchase certain products

When someone purchases a membership from your club store, they receive a tag. That tag unlocks access to your club’s group and member benefits.

## Membership Rules

### Access Membership Rules + Tags

You can manage your membership rules and tags via **a form under your club's page**:

**Path:** Your club's page > **Club Admin** tab > **Membership Rules + Tags** sub-tab

**URL Pattern:** `https://tusa-dev.its.utas.edu.au/clubs/clubs-index/{your-club}/rules/`

**Who Can Access:**

- Club Presidents (organisers)
- Club Admins (group admins)
- TUSA Staff

### Setting Up Tags

With the form, you can configure up to **5 tag-expiry pairs** for your club:

| Field           | What It Does                                        |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tag**         | Select the membership tag (e.g., “Chess Club 2026”) |
| **Expiry Date** | When this tag should expire (DD/MM/YYYY format)     |

#### Example: Annual Membership

Let's say Chess Club has a typical annual membership, and its renewal happens on December 31st:

| Tag             | Expiry     |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Chess Club 2026 | 31/12/2026 |

This means:

- Members with this tag can access the club group
- On 1 January 2027, the tag automatically expires
- Members lose access unless renewal (with next year's tag assigned to their account) 

#### Example: Multi-Year Setup

Let's say Chess Club allows current members to subscribe for coming years:

| Tag             | Expiry     |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Chess Club 2026 | 31/12/2026 |
| Chess Club 2027 | 31/12/2027 |
| Chess Club 2028 | 31/12/2028 |

This allows members to purchase future year memberships with each membership activating and expiring appropriately.

---

### Tag Expiry

In practice, we recommend all tags should have a maximum five-year expiry to maintain updated and proper access control for club admins.

#### Automatic Processing

A system runs every night at 12:05 AM that:

- **Checks** all clubs for expired tags
- **Removes** expired tags from your club settings
- **Updates** access rules automatically
- **Logs** the expiry for audit purposes
- **Notifies** TUSA admin of any expiries

#### Member Impact

When a member’s tag expires:

- They **lose access** to the private club group
- They **cannot see** member-only deals
- They **need to renew** their membership to regain access

#### You Don’t Need to Do Anything

Tag expiry is fully automatic. You don’t need to manually remove old tags or update settings when the year ends.

---

### Common Scenarios

You may step into scenarios below regularly:

#### Starting a New Year

At the start of a new membership year:

- Visit Membership Rules & Tags
  - Your Club's Page > Club Admin > Membership Rules + Tags
- Add the new year tag (e.g., “Your Club 2027”)
- Set expiry to end of that year (31/12/2027)
- Click Save

Old expired tags are automatically cleaned up.

#### Removing All Tags

If you need to remove all membership tags:

- Select “Remove Tag” for all 5 tag slots
- Click Save

This clears all tag requirements from your club.

#### Replacing an Expired Tag

If your current tag has expired, and you need to add a new one:

- Add the new year tag in slot 1
- Set “Remove Tag” for other slots (clears old settings)
- Click Save

---

### Best Practices

To maximum your business performance, we recommend some best practices while setting up your tags:

#### Naming Convention

Use a consistent naming format:

- `Your Club Name YYYY` (e.g., “Chess Club 2026”)
- This matches the membership tags created during affiliation

#### Expiry Dates

- Set expiry to **end of the membership period** (e.g., 31/12/2026)
- Tags expire at **11:59 PM** on the expiry date
- Processing runs at **12:05 AM** the next day

#### Planning Ahead

You can set up multiple years in advance so:

- Members can purchase early
- Tags activate immediately but expire on schedule
- Reduces admin work each year

---

### Understanding the Audit Log

Every tag change is logged for your club:

| What’s Logged    | Purpose                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Tag additions    | Track when rules were set |
| Tag expiries     | Automatic removal record  |
| Who made changes | Accountability            |
| Timestamps       | Timeline of changes       |

TUSA staff can access these logs if issues arise.

---

### Troubleshooting

There might be some tricky scenarios:

#### Members can’t access the group even tag's saved

**Check:**

- Is the tag correctly linked to your membership product?
- Did the member actually purchase the membership?
- Did the purchase go through successfully (not pending or refunded)?

If everything looks right and access still isn’t working, see [Reporting an Issue].

#### Members can still access even tag's expired

**This shouldn’t happen**, an automated daily process removes expired tags. If you notice this:

- Wait 24 hours (the system runs once daily)
- If still not fixed, see [Reporting an Issue]

#### I can’t see the Membership Rules tab

**Check:**

- Are you logged in as a club admin or president?
- Are you on your club’s dashboard (not the main TUSA dashboard)?
- Do you have organiser status in your club group?

---

## Membership Products

When you create a **membership product** in your store, you get additional tag controls.

### Accessing Membership Product Tag Settings

You can manage tags for membership products under their **product settings**:

**Path:** Your **Store Manager** > **Products** tab > your product's settings

- Go to Store Manager
- Navigate to Products
- Create or edit a product
- Select the **Membership** category
- The membership settings section appears automatically

### Product Expiry: Auto-Retire Products

You don’t want to accidentally sell “2025 Membership” in 2026. To avoid this, set a product expiry date for the tag.

| Setting              | What It Does                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Expiration Date**  | When to stop selling this product           |
| **Action on Expiry** | Product goes to “Draft” (hidden from store) |

**Best Practice:** Set expiry to December 31 of the membership year. Adventure clubs might choose end of January to allow for summer trips.

### Tag Application / Membership Activation Upon Purchasing

When someone buys this product, give them membership tags:

| Setting                    | Purpose                                 |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Apply Tags on Purchase** | Tags given to ALL purchasers            |
| **Per-variation tags**     | Additional tags for specific variations |

#### Example: Multi-Year Membership

Your club can manage multi-year membership with multiple tags with respectively expiries:

- Apply Tags: “Chess Club 2026”, “Chess Club 2027”
- Purchaser gets access for both years

### Restrictions via Tags

Control who can see and buy your products:

#### Required Tags (Any)

User must have **at least one** of these tags to see the product.

| Use Case             | Required Tag                        |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Members-only renewal | “Your Club 2025” (existing members) |
| Students only        | “Student”                           |
| Current members only | Your club’s membership tag          |

**Example:** You can have a “2026 Renewal” product that only 2025 members can see.

#### Excluded Tags (Not)

User must **NOT have** these tags to see the product.

| Use Case             | Excluded Tag                |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Exclude juniors      | “Junior”                    |
| Exclude non-students | (use Required Tags instead) |

**Example:** There is an event where insurance doesn’t cover under-18s:

- Excluded Tags: “Junior”
- Juniors cannot see or purchase tickets

### Product vs Variation Restrictions

You can set restrictions at two levels:

| Level               | Controls                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Product level**   | Entire product visibility       |
| **Variation level** | Individual variation visibility |

#### Example – Student vs Non-Student Pricing:

Let's say Chess Club has their membership's price varies depending on whether buyer is a student.

**Product:** “Chess Club 2026 Membership”

- Apply Tags: “Chess Club 2026” (every member this year can see it)

**Variation 1:** “Student – $20”

- Required Tags: “Student”
- Only students see this option

**Variation 2:** “Non-Student – $40”

- Excluded Tags: “Student”
- Only non-students see this option

The settings above will ensure each person can only see the price tier that applies to them.

## Common Membership Scenarios

There are some scenarios that the membership system will always kick in helpful.

### Scenario 1: Simple Annual Membership

Assume:

- Your club's membership renews every year
- Everyone can purchase current year's membership
- Everyone who does not renew will lose their membership automatically
- Current year's membership product will disappear automatically when it's no longer eligible (this year has passed)

Let's say it's the Chess Club again, the **Group Settings (Membership Rules + Tags)** should be:

- Tag: “Chess Club 2026”
- Expiry: 31/12/2026

And the **Product Settings** should be:

- Category: Membership
- Expiry: 31/12/2026
- Apply Tags: “Chess Club 2026”
- No restrictions

Now anyone can buy, gets tag, tag expires end of year, product auto-retires.

### Scenario 2: Members-Only Renewal

Let's say Chess Club only wants 2026 members can see and purchase the 2027 membership product right now (renewal).

In the product settings:

- Apply Tags: “Chess Club 2027”
- Required Tags: “Chess Club 2026”

### Scenario 3: Age-Restricted Event

If an event cannot accommodate underage customers due to reasons such as insurance:

- Excluded Tags: “Junior”

**Result:** Under-18s (Juniors) cannot see or purchase this ticket. Perfect for events where insurance or venue restrictions apply.

### Scenario 4: Student-Only Discount Variation

**Product:**

- Apply your product tags, such as: “Your Club 2026”

**Variation 1 – Student $30**

- Required Tags: “Student”

**Variation 2 – General $50**

- Excluded Tags: “Student”

This will make student members only see the $30 option, and non-students only see $50.

## How Tags Flow Through the System

1. Member purchases product
2. Tags applied to member's account
3. Tags sync to email lists
4. Tags checked against Group Rules
5. If tag matches → Access granted to group
6. Member can see: deals, documents, news feed
7. Daily check on tag expiry
8. When expired → Tag removed → Access revoked

---

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Can I create my own tags?

No. Tags are created by TUSA during affiliation/reaffiliation. Contact TUSA if you need new tags.

### What happens when membership expires?

- The tag is automatically removed (daily at 12:05 AM after expiry date)
- Member loses access to the club group
- They need to purchase new membership to regain access

### Can someone buy membership twice?

Yes, but they’ll just get the same tag again. It won’t hurt anything, but consider whether you want to prevent this with Required Tags (exclude people who already have the tag).

### How do I offer family/group memberships?

This is complex – contact TUSA for advice. One option is to manually apply tags to additional family members.

### My membership product expired – what now?

- Create a new membership product for the new year
- Set up with new year’s tags
- Update your group rules if needed
- The old product stays hidden (as Draft)
