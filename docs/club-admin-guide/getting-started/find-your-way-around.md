# Find Your Way Around

This guide will help you navigate the TUSA website and find what you need. As a club admin, it is important for you to be familar with **three** pages:

1. Your Account Dashboard
2. Your Club Dashboard
3. Your Store Manager

We will also cover important tabs in these pages.

## Your Account Dashboard

Each account will have its own profile page, you can access it by:

- Clicking the avatar on the top right corner, or
- Visiting`https://tusa-dev.its.utas.edu.au/my/members/{your-username}/`
- Replace `{your-username}` with your account's username.

Your account profile page will greet you with:

- Your avatar/photo

- Your name

- Your member type badge (Student, Club Admin, Club President, etc.)

**We encourage members to keep their profile name and avatar accurate**. This information is used to verify identity when accessing deals and other member benefits.

### Account Dashboard Tabs

The account dashboard will also greet you with a tab bar, including tabs below:

## Store Manager (Admin Only)

**URL:** `https://tusa-dev.its.utas.edu.au/store-manager/`

Store manager is where you manage your club's store, including products, orders, and many other settings.

You can access the store manager via the URL above, or you can access it through **Your Account Dashboard > Store Management** tab.

### Why not in Club Dashboard?

For each admin account, **We only allow ONE store of the administrated clubs can be accessed.**

If you're an admin for multiple clubs (so you have access to several different club groups), you still only have store access for ONE of them. If Store Manager was in the club group, clicking it might take you to a different club's store, this may cause confusions and severe issues between your administrated clubs.

### So which is my store?

When you open Store Manager, check the **welcome bar at the top**. It shows which store you're currently managing. Make sure it's the right one before making changes.

### What If I want to change my store?

**Contact TUSA admin,** we will:

- Ask to be **demoted from Organizer** in the club group whose store you currently access

- Ask to be **promoted to Organizer** in the club group whose store you need

You may need to be demoted to regular member first, then re-promote, as getting promoted to a new store requires losing access to the old one.

### What if I need to manage multiple stores?

**Use different login profiles** for each club admin role:

- One login for Club A admin duties

- A different login for Club B admin duties

This avoids access conflicts and keeps things clear, zero confusion about which store you're managing.

_Keep your profile updated for the best experience across the TUSA platform._
